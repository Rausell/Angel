Updates: Added our graphical display into the program. That way when the game runs the image appears until exit out by the user. The image is currently a placeholder for where the text should appear as the text currently appears in our terminal not the created graphical screen.

Currently this document serves as a log for our current working progress on the game as well as keep track of what purpose each file serves. On top of the page we have a breakdown of the files currently being used.
